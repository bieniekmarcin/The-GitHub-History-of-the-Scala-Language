# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language

**Idea and datasets: [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/163)**


## Introduction
<p>"In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.</p>
<p>The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pulls_2011-2013.csv</code> contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.</li>
<li><code>pulls_2014-2018.csv</code> contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.</li>
<li><code>pull_files.csv</code> contains the files that were modified by each pull request."</li>
</ol>
